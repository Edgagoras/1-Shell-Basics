### What is GitHub and git?
We'll spend a lot of time talking about `git` next week, which is a program used for keeping track of different versions of files as they change over time. It is a tool for collaboration. GitHub is separate from git, and is a website and storage service where git repositories can be stored in the cloud and shared with other users in a social way. There are several alternatives to github.com, including bitbucket.org, sourceforge.net, and gitlab.com, but github is by far the most popular of these types of services and is the one we will be using for this course. 


### Sign up for GitHub
You will need to create a GitHub account for this course. The service is completely free
and is a highly trusted source that won't send you spam, so feel free to use your 
school email address if you like.  

+ Go to [http://github.com](http://github.com) and create a new account with your email address. 
+ Select "Unlimited public repositories for free".
+ Skip any surveys by clicking next. 


### Complete the GitHub start guide
When you finish creating your account you will be prompted to complete the 
GitHub starting guide. Complete all steps of this guide to create your first github repository [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). 


### Next, create a new repository for your first assignment
Just like in the GitHub Starting Guide start by creating a new repository and name it 
`assignment-1`. Initialize the repository with a README file. To complete the homework assignments in [https://github.com/programming-for-bio/1-Shell-Basics](https://github.com/programming-for-bio/1-Shell-Basics) create a new branch, edit the README file according 
to the instructions in the repository to include your answers, and then merge the finished product back into the Master branch of your repository. 

### Start learning about git
The program git integrates seamlessly with github to allow for sharing and editing code collaboratively, and storing countless versions of it. As I said, we'll cover the topic a lot next week, but for now, start learning about using the git command line tool by running this online interactive tutorial [https://try.github.io/levels/1/](https://try.github.io/levels/1/]. 


### You have now completed this tutorial.
