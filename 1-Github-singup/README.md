### What is GitHub and git?
We'll spend a lot of time talking about `git` next week, which is a program used for keeping track of different versions of files as they change over time. It is a tool for collaboration. GitHub is separate from git, and is a website and storage service where git repositories can be stored in the cloud and shared with other users in a social way. There are several alternatives to github.com, including bitbucket.org, sourceforge.net, and gitlab.com, but github is by far the most popular of these types of services and is the one we will be using for this course.

### Next, create a new repository for your first assignment
Just like in the GitHub Starting Guide start by creating a new repository and name it 
`assignment-1`. Initialize the repository with a README file. To complete the homework assignments in [https://github.com/programming-for-bio/1-Shell-Basics](https://github.com/programming-for-bio/1-Shell-Basics) create a new branch, edit the README file according 
to the instructions in the repository to include your answers, and then merge the finished product back into the Master branch of your repository.
