# 1-Shell-Basics

Learning to use a bash terminal and the many unix commands that it makes available is key to becoming an efficient and competent programmer, regardless of which programming language you eventually advance to using.

### II. Text editors  
There are many popular text editors and everyone has their own preference. They typically vary in the their size and complexity as well as in the type of key-bindings (short-cut commands to perform common functions) that they support by default. It is good to know at least one common 'bare-bones' text editor that can be run from within a terminal (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, or `emacs`) as well as one good GUI based editor which are more combersome (e.g., `atom`, `sublimetext`). Across all of these there are two common key-binding modes, 'vim-mode' and 'emacs-mode'. I learned emacs key-bindings first and have stuck with that ever since, which is easy to use in `neno` and `emacs`, and is supported in `sublime`. Many others prefer vim key-bindings, which are default in `vim`, `atom`, and `sublime`. Either mode is simple enough to learn in about 20-30 minutes, and there are many good tutorials. 


#### Finish at least one of the following tutorials:
**emacs tutorial**: open `emacs` in a terminal by typing `emacs`. This will open up a splash screen that will say "Welcome to GNU Emacs at the top. Below this you should see a highlighted line that says `Emacs Tutorial`. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor down to this link and then hit enter to open the tutorial.

#### (optional) Fun games to test your skills: 
Learning text editor key-bindings takes practice, practice, practice, but once you learn it the benefits are incredible. You'll feel like a sloth every time you open a word document in the future and are unable to jump to the beginning of a sentence with a simple key stroke, or replace every instance of one word with another without having to click on three menu buttons. Practicing takes time, though, of course.
